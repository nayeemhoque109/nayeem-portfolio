        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>How did you approach the subject? What does your site say about future you?</p>
        <p>This portfolio highlights my interest in the future of technology. Particularly, the future of cars, phones, artificial intelligence and augmented reality.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Who is your audience?</p>
          <p> Anyone can understand how to use my site as it is simple, but my site is a portfolio of my personal interests in technology which may not interest whose who are not interested in technology.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Portfolio 1 (and thoughts about it)</li>
            <p>Ronaldo portfolio <br>There is a lot of information about him on his football abilities.The user innterface and design looks very nice and sticks with an overall theme. The use of fave based animations were very nice.</p>
          <li>Portfolio 2 (and thoughts about it)</li>
            <p>Elon Musk portfolio<br>Very detailed information about him. The design was consistant and nice. There could have been more pictures to go along with the text.</p>
          <li>Portfolio 3 (and thoughts about it)</li>
            <p>Dwayne Johnson portfolio<br>Great amount of  information as well as a good amount of pictures used. The media queries work well. Some aspects look basic and bland, could have added CSS styles and java animations.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>Resource on portfolio creation</p>

        <h2>Planning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Accessibility aspect 1</li>
            <p>I plan on using alternative text for images if browsers cannot load them and for visually impaired users.</p>
          <li>Accessibility aspect 2</li>
            <p>Colours will be bright and large so it is easy to see and read for everyone.</p>
          <li>Accessibility aspect 3</li>
            <p>Sound effects will not be present as I plan on giving the same experience to everyone. If a video were to be used, I would implement captions.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>How have you made the site easy to navigate?</p>
          <p>My site is mainly scroll based which is the easiest form of navigation. The website is ideal for desktops and mobile platforms with the help of media queries, content is not squashed but small enough to retain its design. </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>Learning</p>
        <p>Libraries and other resources</p>
        <p>I have used the google font library and fontawesome bootstrap to get fonts and icons for my werbsite.</p>

        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>What worked well</h3>
          <ul>Overall, the website is nice simple and responsive. I really like the design and layout. Navigation looks nice and CSS responsive behaviour is good. I have added a few accessibility for visually impaired users.
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>What might be improved</h3>
          <ul>Maybe I could have added more features such as fancy graphics and animations. I also could have added more content in my website. Some more accessibility features that I planned should have been added.
          </ul>
